Apparently, it's [PragProgWriMo](https://medium.com/pragmatic-programmers/pragprowrimo-starts-november-1st-39329b7ea346), so this seems like a perfect time to kick myself in the butt and get this blog going again.

I hadn't heard about PragProgWriMo before yesterday. I know a few people who regularly participate in NaNoWriMo, but I have never tried. I'm not a novel writer and I have absolutely no story to tell. But maybe I have some more short stories to tell?

To be honest, I have no idea what I could write about. Everything is really chaotic and weird right now, so there is no one topic I could write about. And I don't even know if there is anything I can write about. But we will see. Maybe I can really use this as kind of a daily blog thing to write about what has been going on during the work day (if it's shareable) and maybe that might even help me see some structure?

Anyway, don't expect much (if there is even anyone reading this anymore), but here we go. First day of 30.
