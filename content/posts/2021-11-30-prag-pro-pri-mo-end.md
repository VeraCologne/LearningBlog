Wow, 30 days of blogging. Which I did not do every day, but at least there is a blog post for each of the 30 days. And it was kind of nice to write something about every day of the month. To be honest, I would not have started watching programming-related videos on the weekends if I had not been looking for something to write about on those days. And I think this is something that I am going to keep up.

There are some interesting things I have learned through this month of blogging. But it's stuff I need to think about for a while. I'm not sure if or how I am going to continue writing here. I guess we will see some time next year.
