I wrote some code today. "What?" I hear you say, "do you even know how to do this?" Well ... a bit, I guess. I see the value in all I am doing with talking to people, helping others and speaking about how to model what we will be implementing, but I do feel like I'm not writing code enough. I don't really know how to change that though. Sometimes I have time at the end of the work day for some uninterrupted coding but then I'm too tired from hours of discussions that I can't get myself to do something productive. And then I feel like I'm losing my knowledge and that scares me, although I know that all the other stuff I do is so much more important then typing stuff into an editor.

This morning when I got up I had the urge to do a little bit of coding though. I started with a small ticket yesterday where we change how we get data from another team. And I finished the first part of it today. That felt good. Just some quiet time and some coding. Maybe I can get more of this during work hours somehow in the next few weeks.
