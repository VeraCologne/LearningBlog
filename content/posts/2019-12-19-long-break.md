I'm going to be away for a while because I am going to a psychosomatic rehab facilitation for about five weeks.

There was quite a long text here, explaining how/why/when I got into therapy and applied for this rehab, but I decided it was too rambly and too personal, so I deleted everything.

The most important thing is: Take care of yourself. Get help when you need it. 

I'm looking forward to it. It will be very weird, being away from home for so long. And it will also be weird being away from work for so long. I am going to switch off all my work-related communication channels. I intend not to open Slack, starting this afternoon, until the day I am back at work. I think I have never done that for more than 2 days. It will be weird. And good.

I'm so excited to learn more about myself and about what I can do to help myself better. And to do lots of physical activity.

Goodbye, have a nice holiday season, see you in February!
