Back from holiday. First real Planning with my new team. First ticket that I worked on on my own. First time doing anything with GraphQL. First pull request opened.

I don't really know what I did there. It was a ticket that was very similar to one they did last week, so I looked at the other pull request, copied some tests and changed a few variables and then tried to get everthing to work. It worked very well for the first 2 layers of code and then I got lost. I managed to get it green by looking for the stuff from the other ticket and add my stuff where it was missing but I didn't know where I was at all. My third commit message was "some type stuff" and then I explained that I just tried to extend this one test and get it green again. RuboCop confuses me. I want my auto formatter back. Everyone else in this team has either a different setup or doesn't run the full test suite locally. I get tons of errors trying to run it that I mostly don't understand.

But I got through the ticket. It *works for me* and the tests all passed on CI. 

This is going to be a wild ride. But it'll all work out. 

And now I'm going to burn some of my pent-up nervous energy at the gym. There's a meetup in our office tonight and I am not going to be in the office for 12 hours straight when there's a gym 2 stories down.
