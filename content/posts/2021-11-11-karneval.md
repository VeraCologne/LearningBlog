No work- or programming-related stuff here today. I am too mad to think about what to write about after seeing the images from the KÃ¶lner Karneval. I don't understand how this is allowed and how we live in a society where so many people refuse to get vaccinated or go to a crowded party when we just had the biggest number of new infections since the beginning of the pandemic.

I'm going to a small conference next week. I'm worried that it's not a good idea. I'm even more worried about more lockdowns and more stupid (as opposed to sensible) rules for everyone. I don't want to be as isolated as we were in the last lockdowns. But I guess we'll all have to deal with what the ignorant, stupid and antisocial minority of covidiots have brought upon us.

The world sucks.
