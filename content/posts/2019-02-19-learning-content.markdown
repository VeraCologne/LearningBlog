We talked about my User Stories yesterday and decided they are okay to start with, from a functional perspective. But the actual reason for me implementing them wasn't written down anywhere. I had chosen those stories mainly for their technical differences so I could learn as much as possible from them.

So one of my tasks for this week is to add the value in terms of my learning to each story. I have started today and I am struggling. There are three obvious things: doing something with user input, consuming events and calling a REST API. But aside from that there are definitely more things in there like all things visual, Phoenix, database handling and so on. A lot of those are part of more than one story and some of them are just a very tiny aspect of a story. So I'm not sure how to note this down yet.
