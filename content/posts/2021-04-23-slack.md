I've read and heard some complaints about Slack in the past few weeks. Too much noise, too hectic, everything is fleeting, ... I really like Slack. I have configured it perfectly for my needs. So here is my setup, along with some links to some excellent help center articles:

I only show [unread](https://slack.com/intl/en-de/help/articles/212596808-Set-your-sidebar-preferences) channels in the sidebar. I don't need to know which channels I belong to, I just want to see all unreads. If I need to write something to a channel, I can [Cmd + T](https://slack.com/intl/en-de/help/articles/201374536-Slack-keyboard-shortcuts-and-commands) to where I want to go.

I [mute](https://slack.com/intl/en-de/help/articles/204411433-Mute-channels-and-direct-messages) all channels that are not absolutely necessary to read often. Since I show all unread channels in the sidebar, I do not miss anything from these channels. They just don't result in an unread badge.

I only get [notified](https://slack.com/intl/en-de/help/articles/201355156-Configure-your-Slack-notifications) for direct messages and mentions. I don't have any notifications for any channels. If someone needs to contact me asap, they can @ me or any [groups](https://slack.com/intl/en-de/help/articles/212906697-Create-a-user-group) I belong to.

I have 3 [sections](https://slack.com/intl/en-de/help/articles/360043207674-Organize-your-sidebar-with-custom-sections): Starred, Team and Noise. Starred is for the 3 channels that I always want to see in order to remind myself to post to them regularly, the 2 coworkers I talk to most often, myself for notes and Slackbot for reminders. Team is for every team channel that is important, for easier access/visibility to those (our main team channel, our dev channel and our wip/feedback channel). And all team members that don't fall into the Starred category live there. Noise is for muted channels that I really never need to see anything from but that I sometimes need to post something to so it would be weird to leave the channel and join every time I need to write something. Muted channels in sections or when not only showing unread channels are very, very muted. I have only 2 channels that fall into this category.

I use 2 types of reminders. I text "remind me to stuff at time" to [Slackbot](https://slack.com/intl/en-de/help/articles/202026038-An-introduction-to-Slackbot) or I use "Remind me about this" for [messages](https://slack.com/intl/en-de/help/articles/208423427-Set-a-reminder) that I should reply to but not right now. This way I don't forget to reply to any questions without the need to answer them when I see them. I don't like to "unread" messages because of the unread badge.

If I really want deep focus without anyone having any chance of interrupting me, I [snooze notifications](https://slack.com/intl/en-de/help/articles/214908388-Pause-notifications-with-Do-Not-Disturb) and quit Slack. This way, I don't get [mobile notifications](https://slack.com/intl/en-de/help/articles/360025446073-Guide-to-Slack-notifications#mobile-notifications) although I'm inactive. I also snooze notifications for my lunch break. If I want to be completely undisturbed by others while on a Slack call (so I can't quit Slack), I set myself inactive, snooze notifications and [hide the call](https://slack.com/intl/en-de/help/articles/1500002037922-Adjust-your-calls-settings-and-preferences#slack-calls-preferences) from my Slack status. I also set myself inactive when I don't want to be seen (Slack help article on setting up for holidays [here](https://slack.com/intl/en-de/help/articles/360003399912-Set-up-Slack-to-go-on-vacation)) or when I don't want people to expect a quick response. In order to not forget to set myself to active again, I let Slack ask if I want to toggle back to active (under Advanced in settings).

I use [1-click emojis](https://slack.com/intl/en-de/help/articles/206870317-Use-emoji-reactions#set-preferences-for-one-click-reactions): eyes for "I'm looking at this right now", checkmark for "I've solved this issue" and thumbsup.

I [pin](https://slack.com/intl/en-de/help/articles/205239997-Pin-messages) messages that are important for a channel. I make sure important discussions happen in channels and not in group direct messages. That makes things easier to find again later and it creates less notifications. I don't "save" important messages. My saved messages are pure kitsch. Someone telling me how awesome I am. Hehe.

I use search very often to find other important stuff though. I usually know which channel and keyword I need. I compose some messages for easier search access, for example with "Summary Weekly:" so I can find all meeting notes for a specific meeting more easily. Sometimes I don't know a keyword to search for but a person or time and Slack lets you search with "from:" and "before:" and other [modifiers](https://slack.com/intl/en-de/help/articles/202528808-Search-in-Slack#filter-your-search-results).

We use tons of integrations for Slack. If you write a [Jira](https://slack.com/intl/en-de/help/articles/218475657-Jira-for-Slack) ticket ID to one of our team channels, links to the ticket with a preview of status/type/assignee etc. The [Github](https://slack.com/intl/en-de/help/articles/232289568-GitHub-for-Slack) app pushes PRs to our dev channel, Heroku shows deployments, our bug tracker notifies about bugs, our logging provider about slow requests and [Google Calendar](https://slack.com/intl/en-de/help/articles/360047938054-Google-Calendar-for-Team-Events-for-Slack) reminds us about meetings. That's just some, we really use a lot of great integrations.

That's it, I think. Oh and I use our brand colours as a [theme](https://slack.com/intl/en-de/help/articles/205166337-Change-your-Slack-theme). But that has nothing to do with productivity, it just looks nice.
