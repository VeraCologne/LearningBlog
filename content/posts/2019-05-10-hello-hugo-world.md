Is this thing on? ([Ohrwurm-Alarm](https://open.spotify.com/track/3LdF68v3DpGluhLtP97s1a?si=ug_BernFSVaqC89MOdNgPw))

Edit, just a short time later: It is! Finally! I have moved my blog and all its posts to a shiny new site! <3

I ended up following parts of this [explanation](https://www.circuidipity.com/hugo/) after deleting everything I had before (including the repository and Netlify project) because I had messed up again. 

I did swear a bit. I was told to calm down a bit. Yeah well, this is stressful. But I did it. 

Next steps: 
- add things like an about page
- figure out how to put links in the sidebar
- add tags to all my posts (ugh)
- do some tiny CSS changes (my titles are a bit long and I don't want line breaks on the index/posts page)
- drink 

Again, I might do the last step first and deal with the rest later. 

Also, I bought the new edition of The Pragmatic Programmer and I'm beyond excited to start reading, so this might be how this site looks for a while. It's a state I can live with, I think. It's better than the endless index page on the old one.
