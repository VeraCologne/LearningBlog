No Knitting + watching a work-related video today. I just needed a break. Work is stressful right now because a lot is happening at the same time and there will be a big planning workshop next week. And I still have building work going on in my house and the weekends are the only time where I can be in my appartment on my own without the builders blocking the whole downstairs. It's still not really comfortable on the weekends because so much stuff is everywhere in the living room and kitchen, but at least there's quiet. They will hopefully be done on Wednesday and then I will take a day off to enjoy the quiet, clean up and put everything back into its place that had to be removed from the bathroom, living room and kitchen.
