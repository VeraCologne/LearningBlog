We finished our workshop today and it was very interesting and very exhausting. Our group consisted mostly of people (me included) who talk a bit much when they start talking. The two stakeholders involved had great ideas but sometimes they had 5 ideas for 3 different problems within one breath and asking some Why questions and understanding their ideas got a bit difficult.

For the second part of our breakout sessions, the Product Owner involved suggested a new process to not focus on one problem and talk about it in depth while also finding solutions, but to look at all the problems and gather some ideas in quiet work. That was a bit better for my brain.

Afterwards we gathered all our ideas in a list that was then clustered and will now be prioritised between stakeholders, POs and devs. I'm excited to see what comes out of it and how we will work on those things together.
