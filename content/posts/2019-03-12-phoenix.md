Today I started working through the Phoenix Guide. In our last review/mentoring session I presented my first draft of a sequence diagram for a first use case for my dashboard project. It was kind of a high-level sequence diagram with a flow similar to the apps we are currently working on. We talked about making this more fine grained to include more parts of the architecture so I can get a better understanding and we can talk about it in more detail. We also talked about making other versions of this with a simpler architecture. A plain Phoenix application without any events for example. We want to talk about and understand the difficulties of implementing these different versions by drawing sequence diagrams that will show how many different parts an application like this needs to have.

For all of this I need a better understanding of Phoenix. I kind of know my way around an existing Phoenix application because I know where to look for things that I can adapt when I want to implement a new feature, but I don't really know the ins and outs of Phoenix.

So that's what I am going to do for this week. Hopefully by the end of the week I will be able to draw more detailed diagrams of my use case. And maybe by following along the guides I can also have some kind of a starting point for my actual application. We will see.
