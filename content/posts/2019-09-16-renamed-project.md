Two days in and I'm already annoyed with my project's working title. It was called Pensieve and that's from the Harry Potter world, and according to [Fandom's wiki](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Pensieve), it's

> a magical object used to review memories. It has the appearance of a shallow stone or metal basin, into which runes and strange symbols are carved and precious stones are fitted. It is filled with a silvery substance that appears to be a cloudy liquid/gas; the collected memories of people who have siphoned their recollections into it.

That's what I thought of when I needed a name to give to `mix phx.new` in order to start the project. Something where I can store what I learned and review it later. But to be honest, the memories one stores in a pensieve are usually a little bit more 'heavy' than "I learned this thing at that date". And I don't think the name makes sense for many people. And it looked weird when typing it.

So I renamed it to SoCraTemps for now. **So**ftware **Cra**ft at Studi**temps**. I'm not sure how long this name will last, but it's better for now than the old one. There was a handy shell script in one of our old applications that I could use to rename all the modules, files and config stuff, but then the application told me that the database did not exist. I briefly thought about just creating a new one with the new name (because there's not really much in it right now) but then I thought this might be an opportunity for a little learning.

I now know how to [rename a PostgreSQL database](http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-rename-database/). And then I also learned how to quit psql's command line. Oops.
