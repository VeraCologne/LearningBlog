I watched another one of the [software-architektur.tv](https://software-architektur.tv/) streams today, the one from last week about getting into software architecture. They were talking a bit about how you have to be interested in architecture and find people to talk about architecture, or a guild (or CoP I guess) and then they talked about the ISAQB certifications.

I guess I've been interested in architecture for a while. And I have already been talking about architecture with my coworkers a lot. After all, I am running the Architecture CoP at jobvalley. But should I do a certification course? I guess now that conferences are not really happening (or only remotely which I don't really like), this would be a good way to invest my training budget, right?
