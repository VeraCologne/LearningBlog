Today I read [this](https://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/software-architecture-patterns.csp) book about Software Architecture Patterns.

I think it provides a good starting point into learning more about architectural patterns and why and when to use specific patterns.

I don't think I have learned a lot that's going to be useful soon. I had already heard/read a bit about event-driven, microservices and layered architecture, some info confused me and I can't really translate everything to applications that I have worked on.

It made me thing about testability of different types of architecture though. And I started to draw a model of our latest application using a ports-and-adapters achitecture explanatory visualisation as a base.

#### Things I don't know much about:
- Testing distributed applications
- Visualising patterns and models (which I think would help me understand stuff better)
