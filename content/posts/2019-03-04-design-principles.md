This one has a subtitle: "Or: Where I give up on the Imposter's Handbook". I just don't get it. Yes, I have heard about YAGNI and DRY and I do think I know what they mean, I have also heard about the Law of Demeter and I think the explanation in this book makes it clear what this means, but for the rest, I just don't understand it. I can't really read the code examples and the explanations around them are too short.

I guess I have to give up on this book. I can't really fault the author because he says in his introduction that it is intended for experienced programmers which I am not.

But what do I do now? Try to find another book that helps me bridge my knowledge gap when it comes to computer science basics? Forget about them until I am a bit more experienced? Hope that my mentors can see where my gaps are and point them out to me (I feel like this is asking way too much).

I struggle with this. It makes me feel really stupid that there are so many things that I read and watch that I don't understand at all. On the other hand I do see that I have improved so much when it comes to my day-to-day work. So maybe I should just focus on this and let everything else be for a while?
