Today we started with the first steps for the final stage of a big project we started at the beginning of the year. Some things were pushed in for both teams involved so we all have not worked on this in a while and we have forgotten a lot. There was a big plan at the beginning of the year, but nobody quite understands it anymore. So we're kind of back at the beginning in some aspects.

It feels like the same is happening with the Covid situation. The last lockdown was when things started getting worse for me and I have not really gotten better in the meantime. And now we are on the verge of the next lockdown and everything feels like we are back at the beginning.

I hope we are done with this soon. Both the big project as well as lockdowns and anti-vaxxers.
