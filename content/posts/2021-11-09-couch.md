I built a couch today. I think that's the most productive thing I did today. I can't really remember.

It was a great day. I was in the office, with one of my favourite coworkers, we had some time where both of us were not in a meeting, so we worked a bit next to each other and chatted about the stuff we were doing (we were both doing lots of small things). And I went for lunch with him and my favourite ex-coworker and it was a very, very nice lunch date with lots of good conversation and just a general feeling of warmth and coziness.

And then I built the couch. So now the office looks a bit nicer, so going there will be even better.
