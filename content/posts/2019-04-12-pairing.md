We finally paired on my problem consuming events and finding my way through our application yesterday and it went great. I paired with my colleague who usually starts from the inside and then goes to the outside, so we ditched my event consumer integration test and went on to the domain model, then the repository, application service and finally found our way back to the event consumer. I now have one way of doing this type of work in a less chaotic way. To do for after my vacation: Do this with the other colleague who does outside-in TDD do I can have another way of doing this.

I also learned so much more, about overridable functions, exceptions, testing just the right stuff and tons about refactoring. I am going to fight hard to do this at least once a week from now on!
