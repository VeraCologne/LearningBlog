I attended a workshop on Mind Management and Bio Hacking (for Tech Leader, hehe) today, at the [Digitale Leute Summit](https://www.digitale-leute.de/summit/21/).

In terms of mind management, there was not really a lot of brand new information for me, but I really liked the structure of the workshop and the approach to gradually research the different topics and then focus on one method from 2â€“3 topics at a time to see what helps you. The topics covered were Be Aware, Relax & Recover, Reflect / Identify / Inquire, Towards Conscious Decisions and Manifestation, Letting Go & Forgiveness and Forming Healthy Habits. The Bio Hacking part wasn't my cup of tea, for several reasons. But there were some interesting ideas for further research as well.

Some resources from the workshop I'm going to look into more now:

- Reiner Kraft's The Mindful Leader [podcast](https://themindfulleader.buzzsprout.com/) and [blog](https://www.themindfulleader.net/blog)
- Byron Katie's [The Work](https://thework.com/)
- John Hargrave's [Mind Hacking](https://www.mindhacki.ng/)
- Using The 5 Whys for personal reflection

And some resources I already knew that the workshop reminded me of that I want to look into again or that I would recommend:

- Casey Watts' [Debugging Your Brain](https://www.debuggingyourbrain.com/)
- Joe Kutner's [The Healthy Programmer](http://healthyprog.com/)
- the Western Australian Government's [Self-Help Resources](https://www.cci.health.wa.gov.au/Resources/Looking-After-Yourself), especially the workbook on [Worrying](https://www.cci.health.wa.gov.au/Resources/Looking-After-Yourself/Worry-and-Rumination)
- the general idea of [Bullet Journalling](https://bulletjournal.com/pages/learn) to organize your thoughts and specifically using [review techniques](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7sGquo8ejI&list=PL86N9FudwTtHSG_WazqcuCpcEEgm7Q7Xh&index=4&t=1s) like those from [Getting Things Done](https://gettingthingsdone.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Weekly_Review_Checklist.pdf) in it
- [Gratitude Journalling](https://ggia.berkeley.edu/practice/gratitude_journal) and lots of other great resources at the [Greater Good Science Center](https://ggia.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley
- Yale University's [The Science of Wellbeing](https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-science-of-well-being) course and Laurie Santos' podcast [The Happiness Lab](https://www.happinesslab.fm/)
- the [MindDoc app](https://www.minddoc.de/app) for mood tracking
