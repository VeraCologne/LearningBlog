Before I paused working on my learning project, I looked into Phoenix a bit more in order to be able to draw my application models. Yesterday I spent some time with our frontend engineer, pairing on showing a calculation to the users of our application and we talked a bit about Phoenix and our application model.

I still have trouble understanding Phoenix and our application(s). The view/template relationship confuses my brain. And what do *we* actually want to do in the different parts of our application? Where do you calculate stuff? Where do you make your business decisions? What does the controller do? How big or small should it be? I have many questions right now. And many more that I already forgot about. One week until the deadline. Everything will be better afterwards.
