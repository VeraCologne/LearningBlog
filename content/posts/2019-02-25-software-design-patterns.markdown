Last week I read my next chapter of the Imposter's Handbook and it was about Software Design Patterns. He mentions 16 patterns but explains them only very briefly so I guess this is more of a chapter for giving the reader a clue about what they could be looking into.

We talked about this in our weekly session today and my mentor suggested the book "Design Patterns in Ruby" as a place where I could find more information. We also talked about how we are not sure if all of those patterns apply to Functional, so I am also going to look into patterns for functional programming.
