I was supposed to go to the conference day of Digitale Leute Summit today and as I said last week, I was not completely sure if it was a good idea given the current incidence rate, but I really wanted to go, so I decided to go since I'm fully vaccinated and don't have any contacts with people from vulnerable groups right now. But it still felt weird. Well sometimes life decides for you. My son was sick last night and I didn't want to go to the other end of the city for the whole day, so I stayed home.

I had a fun day though. We talked about some process stuff in our team because we are in a bit of a storming phase right now, then I went on a cycling trip for a lunch walk with my former coworker and best friend, then I got some help from one of my team mates for a conceptual problem I was struggling with, then I fixed an interesting bug while also having a fun "fight" in a PR for one of our shared repositories, and now I'm watching a dev from another team do some TypeScript coding and geeking about algorithm theory.

Oh and I have a toilet again. Don't ask. I'm celebrating by having a glass of wine. Because.

This is turning into a bit of a Dear Diary blog. Good Night.
