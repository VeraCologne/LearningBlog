I googled "Functional Software Design Patterns" and the first thing that came up was this [talk](https://vimeo.com/113588389) by Scott Wlaschin. The slide that is shown as the preview for the video is one where OO patterns get an FP equivalent. Which is functions, in every case. I have now decided to stop looking deeper into "classic"/OO software design patterns because I can't really use them, and just focus on functional programming patterns. I haven't watched the entire video yet, but will do so once the weather gets worse (and I don't desperately want to spend all my time outside). I'm wondering whether I'll understand this better than the stuff I have read about OO patterns so far or if I'm still too inexperienced, even with FP, to get what it is about.
